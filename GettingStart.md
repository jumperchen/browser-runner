We set the system browser as default (alt+1) ,
you could set other browser's program path(like Firefox,Chrome...etc) in Alt + 2 ...9 .

Window -> Preference -> Browser Runner -> Browser path.


# Jetty Startup Support #

**Since version 1.0.1**

When the port is available which means the Jetty is not start up ,
we could have a preference config to let you control to start it or not.


Notice that the browser still open before the server really start up,
so you might have to refresh the page later. :)
