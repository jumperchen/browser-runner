# Introduction #

Write a plug-in that could help user to open external browser
and run with [Run-Jetty-Run](http://code.google.com/p/run-jetty-run/) Plug-in.

Browser Runner could help you to avoid the boring url typing when you are developing a Web Application with [Run-Jetty-Run](http://code.google.com/p/run-jetty-run/).

# Details #

It work with hot key , focus on the editor/project explorer and click the hot-key ,
then you could wait for browser show up .


We set the system browser as default (Alt+1) ,
you could set other browser's program path(like Firefox,Chrome...etc) in Alt + 2 ...9 .

Or set your personal hot key in Generic -> Keys.

Window -> Preference -> Browser Runner -> Browser path.

  * Need to install Run-Jetty-Run 1.2.1.1 first
